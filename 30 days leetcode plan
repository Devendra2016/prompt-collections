## 📌 Pattern Recognition Decision Trees

### Core Decision Framework (5-Minute Rule)
```
1. Is it asking for optimization? → Consider DP/Greedy
2. Need to find/count paths? → DFS/Backtracking  
3. Shortest path/minimum steps? → BFS
4. Substring/subarray problems? → Sliding Window/Two Pointers
5. Range queries? → Prefix Sum/Segment Tree
6. Sorted data search? → Binary Search
7. Need to track frequency? → Hash Table
8. Parentheses/nested structure? → Stack
9. Tree/Graph structure mentioned? → Tree/Graph algorithms
10. Multiple sorted sequences? → Merge/Heap
```

### Advanced Pattern Combinations
- **Array + DP:** House Robber variants, stock problems
- **Graph + DP:** Path counting, minimum cost paths  
- **Tree + Hash:** Subtree problems, path sum variations
- **Backtrack + Pruning:** N-Queens optimizations, subset generation

**DP:**
- Incorrect state definition
- Missing base cases
- Wrong transition formula
- Space optimization errors

### Performance Optimization Checklist
1. **Time Complexity:** Can we reduce O(n²) to O(n log n) or O(n)?
## 📌 Java-Specific Best Practices & Optimizations

### Essential Java Collections for Interviews
```java
// Arrays and Lists
int[] arr = new int[n];                    // Fixed size array
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();    // Dynamic array
List<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<>(); // For frequent insertions

// Maps and Sets  
Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();           // O(1) average lookup
Map<Integer, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();       // O(log n) sorted map
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();                    // O(1) average lookup
Set<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();                // O(log n) sorted set

// Queues and Stacks
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();             // FIFO
Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();             // Double-ended queue  
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();                  // LIFO (prefer Deque)
PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();     // Min heap by default

// For max heap
PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
```

### Java-Specific Complexity Considerations
- **ArrayList vs LinkedList:** ArrayList for random access O(1), LinkedList for insertions O(1)
- **HashMap vs TreeMap:** HashMap O(1) average, TreeMap O(log n) but maintains order
- **String concatenation:** Use `StringBuilder` for O(n) instead of O(n²)
- **Integer comparison:** Use `Integer.compare(a, b)` instead of `a - b` (overflow safe)
- **Array initialization:** `Arrays.fill(dp, -1)` for memoization

### Common Java Pitfalls in Interviews
1. **Autoboxing overhead:** Use `int` instead of `Integer` when possible
2. **String immutability:** Remember strings are immutable, use StringBuilder
3. **Array bounds:** Always check `i < arr.length` before accessing `arr[i]`
4. **Integer overflow:** Use `long` for large calculations, check for overflow
5. **Null handling:** Initialize collections properly, check for null inputs
3. **Early Termination:** Can we break loops early?
4. **Memoization:** Are we recomputing the same subproblems?
5. **Data Structure Choice:** Is there a more efficient structure?

## 📌 Stress Testing Protocol

### Daily Stress Tests (Last 10 min of practice)
1. **Time Pressure:** Resolve today's medium problem in half the original time
2. **Constraint Changes:** Solve with modified constraints (larger n, different ranges)
3. **Follow-up Variations:** Implement requested modifications on the spot
4. **Bug Introduction:** Intentionally add bug, then debug within 5 min

### Weekly Stress Simulations
- **Week 1:** Phone interview simulation (no IDE, only pseudocode)
- **Week 2:** Whiteboard simulation (paper + pen only)
- **Week 3:** Pair programming simulation (explain while coding)
- **Week 4:** Multiple problem sequence (3 problems in 90 min)

- **Peer teaching:** Explain solutions to each other (30 min sessions)
- **Mock interview partner:** Take turns being interviewer/candidate
- **Accountability check-ins:** Daily progress sharing

### Mentor Check-in Schedule
- **Day 7:** Sprint 1 review + track adjustment
- **Day 14:** Sprint 2 assessment + interview readiness check
- **Day 21:** Sprint 3 evaluation + behavioral prep
- **Day 30:** Final assessment + job search strategy

### Community Engagement Guidelines
- **Daily:** Share one insight or problem solution approach
- **Weekly:** Participate in pattern discussion threads
- **Bi-weekly:** Write detailed solution explanation for complex problem
- **End of program:** Create comprehensive pattern guide to help others

## 📌 Tools & Environment Setup

### Required Tools
- **IDE:** VS Code with extensions (Python/Java/C++ debugger, LeetCode plugin)
- **Timer:** Pomodoro timer app with custom intervals
- **Note-taking:** Notion/Obsidian for pattern notes and progress tracking
- **Screen recording:** For communication practice (OBS Studio/Loom)
- **Whiteboard:** Physical or digital (Excalidraw) for problem sketching

### LeetCode Setup Optimization
- Create problem lists for each sprint
- Set up custom timer for each difficulty level
- Enable compiler with test case debugging
- Use built-in note-taking for pattern recognition
