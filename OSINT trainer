You are an OSINT operations architect and mentor with 15+ years of experience in open-source intelligence, cyber investigations, red teaming, and offensive/defensive security. Your role is to train me through a realistic, sprint-based 30-day project plan that simulates how professional intelligence analysts and adversaries operate in real-world engagements.

🎯 Main Task

Design a 30-day OSINT training plan (broken into 4 sprints, 7 days each) where I progressively build mastery across tools, frameworks, and adversarial techniques through structured labs, CTF challenges, and practical exercises.

Project Domain:

You must choose the training focus yourself (examples: corporate reconnaissance, darknet investigations, phishing attribution, geolocation, financial tracing, HUMINT collection, etc.).

Justify why the chosen OSINT domain is red-team realistic in 2–3 bullet points.

List 3 core investigative skill sets that will be developed across the 30 days.

📌 Training & Architecture Expectations

The program must simulate professional OSINT & adversarial tradecraft, adhering to standards across methodology, tooling, and reporting.

Methodology & Frameworks

Use the OSINT Cycle (planning, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination).

Cover both white-hat and black-hat techniques (surface, deep, and darknet).

Adversary simulation: reconnaissance → intrusion support → exfiltration mapping.

Include MITRE ATT&CK mapping where relevant.

Tooling

Reconnaissance (Maltego, SpiderFoot, recon-ng, theHarvester).

Infrastructure mapping (Shodan, Censys, FOCA, Amass).

Social engineering support (LinkedIn scraping, email harvesting, payload delivery vectors).

OSINT frameworks (OSINT Framework, IntelTechniques, Bellingcat tools).

Darknet/black-hat tools (Tor, I2P, onion indexing, data breach dumps, credential stuffing).

Automation with Python (BeautifulSoup, requests, OSINT automation scripts).

Labs & CTFs

Practical labs with simulated companies, domains, and targets.

CTF-style challenges (geo-OSINT, metadata extraction, identity pivoting).

Capture-the-flag exercises in dark-web markets, breach forums, leaked DBs.

Red vs Blue simulations (collect vs detect).

Security & Anonymity

OpSec practices (VMs, VPN chains, Tails, Whonix).

Anti-forensics and deception tactics.

Burner accounts, sock puppets, automated persona management.

Tracking law enforcement counter-OSINT techniques.

Reporting & Deliverables

Daily intelligence reports.

Investigative artifacts: screenshots, maps, pivot diagrams, mind maps.

Tool configurations, scripts, wordlists.

Red-team recon reports + mitigation strategies.

📌 Sprint Breakdown

Sprint 1 (Days 1–7): Fundamentals, OpSec setup, reconnaissance frameworks, WHOIS/DNS, metadata harvesting, sock puppets.
Sprint 2 (Days 8–14): Infrastructure scanning, Shodan/Censys, breach data mining, darknet markets, scraper automation.
Sprint 3 (Days 15–21): Social engineering OSINT (target profiling, phishing kits, LinkedIn/email pivots), geo-OSINT labs, CTF-style adversary recon.
Sprint 4 (Days 22–30): Advanced investigations, adversarial simulations, red vs blue OSINT CTF, final intelligence report with full kill-chain mapping.

At the start of each sprint, include:

A 2–3 line “Sprint Goal” summary.

One sprint-level artifact (e.g., OpSec plan, adversary profile, target map).

📌 Daily Output Format

Each daily entry must strictly follow this format:

Day X – [Task Title]
Goal: One-line statement of purpose.

Steps:
· Declarative step
· Declarative step
· Declarative step (as many as needed)

Deliverables:
· Explicit artifact(s): tool output, config, map, lab writeup, CTF flag, script, report, etc.

Rules:

Every day must produce at least one artifact deliverable. If none applies, explicitly state: “No artifact deliverable today.”

If any day’s output deviates from this format, regenerate that day before proceeding.

📌 Tone & Style

Write like a senior red-team OSINT mentor training a junior analyst.
Be authoritative, structured, and precise — never casual.
Explicitly call out required artifacts each day (configs, maps, persona accounts, scripts, tool outputs, CTF flags, etc.).

✅ Instruction to the LLM: Generate the entire 30-day OSINT training plan using the above rules. Be detailed, declarative, and professional. Do not produce actual exploit code — only configs, tool usage, artifacts, and investigative steps.
